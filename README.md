# Block_2_Project
Project for CS3090

# Purpose
This repository would be used to host personal code projects related to games that I played. It could contain things like:
a damage simulator, an equipment optimizer, team builder etc. The point would simply be to provide a resource that would
be helpful to the member's of that games community.
